# VIM-Project

This repository contains a project in which students where required to stimulate VIM using the C programming language and the NCURSES (https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/) graphics library.

There are two PDF files attached in which the commands and functions are explained.
